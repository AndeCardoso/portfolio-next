      TEXT: "I consider myself an easy-going person with the ability to interact effectively with various types of people. I enjoy learning from others and exploring different approaches to problem-solving. I am always eager to assist and support others with their tasks and challenges.\n In 2012, I attended the Lutheran University of Brazil, also known as ULBRA, focusing on C# with ASP.NET MVC and Windows Phone development. Although I didn't complete the program at that time, I am currently returning to finish my degree.\n My priorities include maintaining code quality and ensuring a positive user experience. I take pride in my proficiency in identifying and resolving bugs.",
