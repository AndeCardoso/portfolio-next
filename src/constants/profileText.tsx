relative ease and speed. Often, by simply analyzing something that
is already in operation and addressing a need, I can benefit much
more than in a theoretical class with generic example projects.
With a great aptitude for artistic activities, I have always been
recognized as the 'Front-End Guy,' creative and innovative in
ideas, capable of adding personality to everything I do.\n\nHowever,
I also see myself as very logical and rational. I always think
twice if a task could be better utilized, if there isn't a more
agile and efficient solution for a process.`;
